# GitLab on ECS

This project implements a scalable GitLab deployment on Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) using Terraform.

## Architecture Overview

This infrastructure-as-code project sets up a GitLab instance on AWS ECS, leveraging several AWS services to create a robust and scalable environment. Here's how the key components work together:

### ECS Cluster

The core of the deployment is an ECS cluster, which manages the containerized GitLab application. The cluster is configured to:

- Auto-scale based on CPU and memory utilization
- Use Fargate for serverless container management

### Load Balancing

An Application Load Balancer (ALB) is implemented to:

- Distribute incoming traffic across multiple GitLab containers
- Handle SSL/TLS termination for secure communication

### Data Persistence

To ensure data durability:

- Amazon EFS is used for shared storage across GitLab containers
- RDS PostgreSQL instance serves as the primary database

### Networking

The infrastructure is set up within a custom VPC, featuring:

- Public and private subnets across multiple Availability Zones
- NAT Gateways for outbound internet access from private subnets

### Security

Security measures include:

- Security groups controlling inbound and outbound traffic
- IAM roles and policies for fine-grained access control

## Custom GitLab Image

A custom Docker image for GitLab is built to:

- Include specific configurations tailored for ECS deployment
- Optimize for performance in a containerized environment


## Scaling and High Availability

The infrastructure is designed for high availability and scalability:

- ECS service is configured to maintain a minimum number of tasks
- Auto-scaling policies adjust the number of tasks based on load
- Multi-AZ deployment ensures resilience against zone failures

## Monitoring and Logging

Observability is achieved through:

- CloudWatch for metrics and log aggregation
- X-Ray for distributed tracing (if implemented)

## Customization and Extension

The project is designed to be easily customizable. Key areas for potential extension include:

- Implementing CI/CD pipelines for GitLab updates
- Integrating with external authentication systems
- Adding backup and disaster recovery solutions

For detailed configuration options and advanced customization, refer to the individual Terraform files and module documentation.
